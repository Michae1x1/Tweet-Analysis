        "\n",
        "It's important to note that the New York Times is a reputable news source that often reports on difficult or negative events, such as wars, natural disasters, or political scandals. As a result, their tweets may include more negative content than tweets from other sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "It may also be the case that people are more likely to share negative news (negativity bias) on social media than positive news, which could lead to a higher proportion of negative tweets from the New York Times.\n",
        "\n",
        "For future work, It could be valuable to conduct sentiment analysis on a larger data set of tweets from the New York Times and potentially other news sources in order to gain a more thorough understanding of this phenomenon."
